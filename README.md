I am Archishman Saha, a final year Dual Degree (BTech+MTech) student at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. I'm currently majoring in Electrical Engineering with a Specialization in Microelectronics. Also pursuing a minor in Computer Science and Engineering

I am interested in the field of Solid State Devices and am looking for exciting and challenging opportunities to collaborate on a plethora of things ranging from quantum devices and quantum transport to spintronics, and so on. I have programming knowledge on Python, MATLAB, Scilab, C/C++ and am always open to learn new simulation tools and frameworks.

You could reach out to me at archishman.saha@gmail.com if interested to collaborate on projects in the field of Devices.
